ðŸ“¦ Folder Export/Import Tool â€“ Powerful & Flexible Data Packaging

A lightweight yet powerful Python tool that lets you export any folder into a single .txt or .json file and later import it back with the full original file/folder structure restored.
It supports optional compression, AES-256 password encryption, ignore patterns, and a progress bar for a smooth experience.

It can also be used to convert your entire programming project (folder + files) into a well-structured text format, making it easy to send to AI tools for bug fixing and code improvements by intelligent models.

Additionally, it helps you combine all your files and subfolders into one single text file, reducing clutter and making storage or sharing much simpler and more efficient.

The tool works in both interactive mode and command-line mode, making it ideal for developers, researchers, and programmers who need a clean and portable way to package, restore, or review their files â€” even with AI assistance.
